<h1>My Notes</h1>
<b>The Web<b/>
  <p> The web is composed of 3 major elements. The user or the browser which is operated by the user, the interner and the servers which communicate with the Interner via the http protocol.</p>
  <!--I don't understand why my paragraph is in bold -->
  <b>HTML</b>
  <p> HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Languages</em> and can be broken down into 4 main categories:<br>- text content<br>- markups<br>- references to other documents<br>- links to other pages</p>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>Html documents are also made of tags and elements. ''< b >'' for example is an opening tag (wihtout the spaces) and is closed by the closing tag ''< /b >''. Whatever is written inbetween the two tags is the content and will be displayed as bold in this specific example. The whole thing, ''< b > content < /b >'' is called an element.</p>
  <b> Whitespace </b>
  <p>To create whitespace it is necessary to use elements, we can use either < br > which stands for break and this doesn't need a closing tag as it will just break the line in the point where it is placed. Breaks are inline elements, like < b >, < a >, etc. which means they don't really occupy a ''physical'' space in the website, what was referred to as a ''box'' in the videos.<br>
    This is what happens when we're using block elements, they occupy a physical space, so for example if we use <pr>, which stands for paragraph, it automatically creates whitespace around itself, but in this case we will need to close the element putting the closing tag < /pr > at the end of the paragraph.
